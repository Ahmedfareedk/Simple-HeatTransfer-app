    <string name="heat_transfer_brief">
        Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the
        exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems.
        Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation.
    </string>
    <string name="conduction_brief">
        is the movement of heat from one solid to another one that has different temperature when they are touching each other.
        For example, we can warm our hands by touching hot-water bottles.</string>
    <string name="convection_brief">
     is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids.
        Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases.
        Although often discussed as a distinct method of heat transfer.
    </string>
    <string name="radiation_brief">
        is the transfer of internal energy in the form of
        electromagnetic waves. For most bodies on the Earth, this radiation lies in
        the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
